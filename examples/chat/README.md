# Chat example


## Server

Chat server listens for incoming TCP connections. Server can access several types of message:

  * `/list` - list all available rooms
  * `/join name` - join room, if room does not exist, create new one
  * `some message` - just string, send message to all peers in same room
  * client has to send heartbeat `Ping` messages, if server does not receive a heartbeat 
  message for 10 seconds connection gets dropped
  
To start server use command: `cargo run --bin server`

## Client

Client connects to server. Reads input from stdin and sends to server.

To run client use command: `cargo run --bin client`
