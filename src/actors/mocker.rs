//! Mocking utility actor.
//!
//! This actor wraps any actor, and replaces instances of that actor with
//! mocker actor, which is able to accept all messages which the actor can
//! receive.
//!
//! Mocking is intended to be achieved by using a pattern similar to
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[cfg(not(test))]
//! type DBClientAct = DBClientActor;
//! #[cfg(test)]
//! type DBClientAct = Mocker<DBClientActor>;
//! ```
//! Then, the actor should be used as a system service (or arbiter service, but
//! take care that all the places which will use the mocked actor are on the
//! same arbiter). Thus, in a test, it will retrieve the mocker from the
//! registry instead of the actual actor.
//!
//! To set the mock function in the actor, the `init_actor` function
//! is used, which allows the state of an actor to be set when it is
//! started as an arbiter or system service. A closure which takes
//! `Box<Any>` is evaluated for every message, and must return
//! `Box<Any>`, specifically the return type for the message type
//! send.
//!
//! See the mock example to see how it can be used.
